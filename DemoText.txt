# HEre, we have deployed gateway, database nodes, 
zookeeper all on same machine for now.
# All the database nodes access their own database
# Each database node launches its own flask api on an ephemeral port
# Each node registers itself to zookeeper on staryt
# Now we show existing contents of all three db nodes databases


# Gateway API  is hosted on port 5000, let's access the contents

# As you can see, for 3 db nodes we have launched, 
# we have write and read quorums of 2 each

Now we demonstrate concurrent writes

So node 1 has orange as 2 quantity and version = 2, and node 2 has orange = 3 quantity and version =- = 2
this is aconcuurent write, here we pick up the minimum quantityand update in bth

the nodes

so as u can see, the output came as latest version and min quantity
of concurrent write values,. let' check the db


Now we demonstrate concurrent writes for user cart

so, in user 1 we have different values for orange and apple in both nodes
having same version, so concurrent writes. let's extract the data froma pi

here, we keep maximum of each product in cart

as u can see, here apple and orange have become maximum of all carts with
latest version

New user can be added by sending a post request to gateway
As u can see, corresponding to write quorum of 2, we got user data in 2 nodes

The crush map is updated dynamicallly as and when nodes are added and 
removed
As you can see on write, the current configuration is when there 
is no database node added.

Now this is the map when a database node has been added to the cluster

Now we will remove a node
Now we will remove all db nodes

as u can see, crush map has aghain become empty
